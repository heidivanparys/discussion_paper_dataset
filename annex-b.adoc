== Overview of principles for good definitions

This document refers several times to principles for good definitions, such as:

* a definition should be brief
* a definition should be neither too broad nor too narrow
* a definition should take into account the target audience
* a definition should pass the substitution test

For more information on these principles, see [ISO 704:2009], [Nordterm] and [Seppälä17].
